# Image Annotator

This repository contains the instruction to set up a GUI image annotator for CV purposes. More precisely this tool allows the user to load an image to annotate it, i.e. to select a number of points in the image and save the results, both graphically and coordinate wise.

### Requirements

This tool is base on `ImageJ` and thus requires a JAVA environment to run.

### Installation

- Download `ImageJ` from [here](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html)
- Append the content of `ClickCoordinatesTool.txt` to `ImageJ\macros\StartUpMacros.txt`
- Run `ImageJ` and enjoy!

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Flavio Bertini that pointed me to this tool.
